README file for the virtual-pet-shelter project

 If all pets are adopted, the game ends.  (Assume that paid employees are still
 working in case a pet comes in to be admitted).

 To get a Cage Status to be "Dirty", a pet needs to both pee and poop, and activity
 level must be less than 33.   

 Pets will need to pee after they are watered, and poop after they are fed.

 If you clean their cage, they will be let outside and not need to pee or poop.
 If you walk them, they will not need to pee or poop.
 If you let them out, they will not need to pee or poop.

 Just playing with them does NOT change their need to pee or poop.
